## General Info
A Tic-Tac-Toe simulation game created using C# with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game supports two modes:

- Player vs. Player: Two players take turns making moves on the same computer.
- Player vs. AI: One player competes against an AI opponent, with the AI making random moves.
  
The goal of the game is to align three of your marks (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
